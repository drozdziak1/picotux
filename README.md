# Picotux
Picotux is meant to be a dead simple, efortless way to set up a minimal Linux VM
in QEMU for kernel development using BusyBox for basic utilities and Linux'
initramfs generation tools. Thanks to the really simple Makefile Picotux should
make it easy to set anything to your liking.

# How to build
```sh
	$ make
	$ make run
```
